The media franchise of "Yosuga no Sora" has produced a total of nine music albums that are related to different versions of the story. Three of these albums are based on the original visual novel that was released in 2008, which follows the romantic relationships of a pair of twins and their friends. One album is derived from the fan disc "Haruka na Sora", which is an expansion of the visual novel that adds new routes and scenarios. The remaining five albums are associated with the anime adaptation that aired in 2010, which covers four of the main heroine arcs and the twins' arc. However, some of these albums have variations in their titles depending on the source, such as the official website, online retailers, or music databases. Therefore, to avoid confusion, their normalized titles are provided according to the style guidelines from MusicBrainz.[8], which is a community-maintained open source music encyclopedia.
